Overview - Shawn & Irwin
Our app is designed to connect local farmers and vendors who typically set up at local farmers markets with local consumers, restaurants, food banks and pantries. Built on an e-commerce platform incorporating social connections, like reviews and location-based recommendations, consumers can purchase products from these farmers and vendors, make donations to food banks and pantries, while farmers and vendors can donate items they have in stock or in surplus to fill the seasonal needs of local food banks and pantries.
